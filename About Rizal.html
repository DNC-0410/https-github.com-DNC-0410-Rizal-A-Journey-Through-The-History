        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>José Rizal (born June 19, 1861, Calamba, Philippines—died December 30, 1896, Manila) was a patriot, physician, and man of letters who was an inspiration to the Philippine nationalist movement.</p>
        <p>The son of a prosperous landowner, Rizal was educated in Manila and at the University of Madrid. A brilliant medical student, he soon committed himself to the reform of Spanish rule in his home country, though he never advocated Philippine independence. Most of his writing was done in Europe, where he resided between 1882 and 1892.</p>
        <p>In 1887 Rizal published his first novel, Noli me tangere (The Social Cancer), a passionate exposure of the evils of Spanish rule in the Philippines. A sequel, El filibusterismo (1891; The Reign of Greed), established his reputation as the leading spokesman of the Philippine reform movement. He published an annotated edition (1890; reprinted 1958) of Antonio Morga’s Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas, hoping to show that the native people of the Philippines had a long history before the coming of the Spaniards. He became the leader of the Propaganda Movement, contributing numerous articles to its newspaper, La Solidaridad, published in Barcelona. Rizal’s political program included integration of the Philippines as a province of Spain, representation in the Cortes (the Spanish parliament), the replacement of Spanish friars by Filipino priests, freedom of assembly and expression, and equality of Filipinos and Spaniards before the law.</p>
        
        <h2>Rizal's Role in the Philippine Revolution</h2>
        <p>Though he advocated for peaceful reforms, Rizal's writings inspired the Philippine Revolution against Spanish rule. He was accused of sedition and executed by firing squad in Bagumbayan (now Luneta Park) on December 30, 1896.</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>Rizal remains a symbol of Filipino nationalism and intelligence. His ideas about freedom and education continue to inspire generations.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Jose Rizal dedicated his life to awakening Filipino consciousness and fighting for the country's independence through his writings. His bravery and wisdom make him an enduring national hero of the Philippines.</p>
